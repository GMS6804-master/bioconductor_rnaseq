# General Assignment Guidelines

## Assignments

This assignment will require you to (1) build a bioconductor docker image from a dockerfile and (2) use the docker container to complete the RNA-seq tutorial.

### Prerequisites
You will need to be comfortable with the following:
* You have installed docker.
* You can pull/push to DockerHub from command-line.

### Part 1: Build a Docker Image 

### Part 2: Complete RNA-seq Tutorial

# build bioconductor-asciinema docker image

This assignment walks you through modifying an [bioconductor docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/bioconductor/bioconductor_docker) by installing [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/docs/installation) and saving the new docker image to dockerhub. [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/about) is a free and open source solution for recording terminal sessions and sharing them on the web.
