# Assignment Guidelines

## Assignments

This assignment will require you to (1) build a bioconductor docker image from a dockerfile and (2) use the docker container to complete the RNA-seq tutorial. You will build a [bioconductor docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/bioconductor/bioconductor_docker) image using a dockerfile and push the image to DockerHub. [Docker Hub](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-hub) is a hosted repository service provided by Docker for finding and sharing container images with others.

### Prerequisites
You will need to be comfortable with the following:
* You have installed docker.
* You can pull/push to DockerHub from command-line.
